Description of Movies Project:

A local movie rental store wishes to automate their inventory tracking system. Currently there are three types of movies/videos (in DVD media) to be tracked:

Comedy (denoted as ‘F’ for funny)
Drama (denoted as ‘D’)
Classics (denoted as ‘C’)
Borrows and returns of items by customers are also to be tracked. Four types of actions are desired in the system:

Borrow (denoted as ‘B’): (stock – 1) for each item borrowed  
Return (denoted as ‘R’): (stock + 1) for each item returned
Inventory (denoted as ‘I’): outputs the inventory of all the items in the store
History (denoted as ‘H’): outputs all the transactions of a customer 
 

You will design and implement a program that will initialize the contents of the inventory from a file (data4movies.txt), the customer list from another file (data4customers.txt), 
and then process an arbitrary sequence of commands from a third file (data4commands.txt).
